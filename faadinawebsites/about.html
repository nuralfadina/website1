            <h1>ABOUT BLUMM.RC</h1>
            <p>This website resume is for my job application. I am currently pursuing my Diploma in course Information Management at Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM) and looking for a career where I can get new experience, excellent interpersonal skills, and willingness to contribute to a great company to excellent use. Aside from that, I would like to work in a professional and dynamic environment where I can utilise and develop in this position.</p>
            <p> Besides that, I am not participating in any organization that has an affiliation with UiTM Rembau. However, I am still active as a project manager in conducting the program for my final project assessment. The program, namely "Program Pemurnian dan Literasi, this is a part of initiatives, ideas and all the contributions from students completing their diploma in Information management last semester and also from our lecturer. In fact, in order for the program to be successful, I had to ensure that all of the students were engaged and worked well together.</p>
            <p>Moreover, I have also involved myself in volunteering when I have free time. The organisation that I joined is the Great Vision Charity Association. This is one of the non-profit organisations that has had a significant impact on both other people and myself. They have invited me to participate in various activities, and I have also organised my own charity events and received financing from the Great Vision Chairty Association. This was one of my biggest accomplishments while completing my Diploma. In fact, these two programs have involved an orphanage and children from Great Heart Community.</p>
